# swervebot
Code for the ESHS P.O.T.A.T.O.E.S. swerve drive test platform.

## Class overview

## To-do list
1. Temporarily disable feedForward mechanism (example code) to see what PID controller does, and vice versa. Test to see if we like how the feedForward mechanism works with the PID controller
2. Socialize with multiple teams at competitions in order to learn more about robotics in general (buisness cards included)
3. Measure the height of each coral branch and associate number of rotations to each height. Then set each of those values to the corresponding variables in Constants.java.
